# Auto-Ad-Skipper-for-YouTube
Chrome Extension that automatically skips YouTube ads 


This is a very simple chrome extension which will automatically press the skip button on YouTube videos. This is not an Ad Blocker so it won't be blocked by YouTube. It doesn't block ads but simply presses the Skip button automatically when possible.

The extension made particularly for differently abled people who sometimes have difficulty pressing the skip button and to help disabled people skip ads on YouTube if they wish to.

The extension works,
 
- in full screen
- for multiple consecutive ads
- for ads in the middle of long videos
- when videos are playing as part of a playlist
- when videos are playing in "picture-in-picture" mode


Also,

- it doesn't track you
- it doesn't collect any of your data
- the code is open source and available to download in GitHub
- any developer collabroation is welcome

*V1.0.0 doesn't do anything on unskippable ads.*


Features in pipeline for future release - 

- mute the audio of the chrome tab for unskippable ads, and bring back to original audio levels after the ad finished playing.
- fast forward through the unskippable ads.
- reduce brightness to lowest when unskippable ads are playing, and bring back to original brightness levels after the ad finished playing.
