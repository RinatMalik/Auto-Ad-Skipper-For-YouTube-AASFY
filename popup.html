  <h2>Auto Ad Skipper For YouTube (AASFY)</h2>
  <p>This extension constantly looks for the skip ad button in YouTube and presses the button as soon as it is found</p>
  <p>It works out of the box, no login, no registration or setup required. This is not an Ad Blocker so it is undetectable by YouTube.</p>
  <button id="activateButton">Activate</button>
